Project
=========
deepAzure is a .Net project to demonstrate the usage of cloud computing technologies to enable the development of complex and powerful algorithms. 
By now the solution implements a Chess Algorithm that allows a user to Play against the Cloud. The Client solution is implemented in HTML5 and developed using TypeScript language.
The final solution will be able to support multiple Chess Engines that implement the proposed JSON protocol and arrange tournaments with ELO ranking evaluation of the results.

Vision
=========
The vision of deepAzure is to use a Cloud Computing approach to develop complex algorithms and be able to compare and evaluate the different Cloud implementations.

Current Status
==============
deepAzure project is in an early stage of development

Live Sample
=========
The last stable version of the Project is hosted as a Windows Azure Web Site as a free sample way to evaluate the solution.
